faqs:
  - question: "How long does ceramic coating last in Dubai's climate?"
    answer: "Professional-grade ceramic coatings typically last 2-5 years in Dubai's harsh environment, depending on the coating tier and maintenance. Our premium 9H coatings can last up to 7 years with proper care. The extreme heat, sand, and UV exposure in the UAE make regular maintenance crucial for longevity."
  - question: "Is ceramic coating better than wax or sealants?"
    answer: "Yes, ceramic coating provides significantly superior protection compared to traditional wax or sealants. While wax lasts weeks and sealants last months, ceramic coatings last years. They create a permanent nano-ceramic shield that's harder, more durable, and provides better protection against UV, chemicals, and scratches—essential for Dubai's extreme conditions."
  - question: "Can ceramic coating be applied over PPF?"
    answer: "Applying ceramic coating over Paint Protection Film is highly recommended and a popular choice among Dubai's luxury car owners. The coating adds an extra layer of protection, enhances gloss, makes the PPF easier to clean, and extends its lifespan. This combination provides ultimate protection."
  - question: "How much does ceramic coating cost in Dubai?"
    answer: "Professional ceramic coating in Dubai ranges from AED 2,500 for basic packages to AED 8,000+ for premium multi-layer systems on luxury vehicles. Pricing depends on vehicle size, coating quality, number of layers, and paint correction requirements. Supercars and larger SUVs typically require more product and labor."
  - question: "Does my car need paint correction before ceramic coating?"
    answer: "Yes, paint correction is essential before ceramic coating application. The coating locks in whatever condition the paint is in, so any swirls, scratches, or imperfections will be sealed permanently. We perform thorough paint correction to ensure your vehicle achieves a flawless, mirror-like finish before coating application."
  - question: "How do I maintain ceramic coating?"
    answer: "Ceramic coating is low-maintenance but not maintenance-free. Regular washing (every 1-2 weeks in Dubai's dusty environment) with pH-neutral soap is essential. Avoid automatic car washes with harsh brushes. We recommend professional detailing every 6 months and optional ceramic booster sprays to maintain hydrophobic properties and gloss."

## The Science of Permanent Protection

Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with your vehicle's paint, creating a permanent nano-ceramic layer of protection. This molecular bond creates a hydrophobic, scratch-resistant surface that repels water, dirt, and contaminants.

Unlike traditional waxes that sit on top of paint and wash away, ceramic coating becomes part of your vehicle's surface. The result is a stunning, mirror-like finish with unparalleled protection against Dubai's harsh UV rays, sand, and environmental contaminants.

### Key Features

- **Mirror Finish**: Deep, reflective gloss enhancement
- **Hydrophobic**: Water beads and rolls off instantly
- **9H Hardness**: Scratch and swirl resistance
- **Chemical Resistant**: Protection from bird droppings, tree sap, and harsh cleaners

## Why Dubai Vehicles Need Ceramic Coating

Dubai's extreme climate demands superior paint protection. With temperatures exceeding 50°C, intense UV radiation, frequent sandstorms, and high humidity near the coast, your vehicle's paint faces constant assault.

Ceramic coating provides the ultimate defense, maintaining your car's showroom finish despite the harsh environment.
