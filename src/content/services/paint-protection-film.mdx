faqs:
  - question: "How long does Paint Protection Film last in Dubai's climate?"
    answer: "Premium PPF typically lasts 7-10 years in Dubai's harsh climate when properly maintained. Our high-grade films are specifically designed to withstand extreme heat, UV exposure, and sandstorms common in the UAE. We use self-healing technology that repairs minor scratches with heat exposure."
  - question: "Will PPF damage my car's original paint?"
    answer: "No, professional-grade PPF actually protects your original paint. Our installation process is completely safe and the film can be removed without damaging the factory paint. In fact, PPF preserves your paint's condition, which is especially valuable for maintaining resale value in the UAE luxury car market."
  - question: "How much does full PPF installation cost in Dubai?"
    answer: "Full vehicle PPF installation typically ranges from AED 8,000 to AED 25,000 depending on the vehicle size, film quality, and coverage area. Supercars and luxury vehicles may require premium films and precision work. We offer customized packages including front-end protection, full body coverage, and high-impact areas."
  - question: "Can PPF be applied to matte or wrapped vehicles?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer specialized PPF designed for matte finishes and vinyl wraps. These films maintain the unique texture and appearance of matte paint or custom wraps while providing the same level of protection. This is particularly popular among Dubai's supercar owners with custom finishes."
  - question: "How long does PPF installation take?"
    answer: "Full vehicle PPF installation typically takes 3-5 days depending on the vehicle's complexity and coverage area. Front-end or partial coverage can be completed in 1-2 days. We ensure proper curing time in our climate-controlled facility to guarantee perfect adhesion and finish quality."
  - question: "Does PPF require special maintenance?"
    answer: "PPF is low-maintenance but benefits from regular care. We recommend hand washing or touchless car washes, avoiding harsh chemicals, and periodic professional detailing. In Dubai's dusty environment, regular cleaning prevents sand particle buildup. Our maintenance packages ensure your PPF stays pristine year-round."
