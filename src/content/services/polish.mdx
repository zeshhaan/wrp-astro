# FAQs
faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between polishing and waxing?"
    answer: "Polishing is a corrective process that removes a thin layer of clear coat to eliminate scratches, swirls, and oxidation, restoring the paint's true color and gloss. Waxing is a protective process that adds a layer on top of paint. Think of polishing as paint correction and waxing as protection. In Dubai's harsh climate, both are essential for maintaining luxury vehicles."
  - question: "How often should I polish my car in Dubai?"
    answer: "For daily-driven vehicles in Dubai, professional polishing is recommended every 6-12 months depending on usage and storage conditions. Garage-kept vehicles may only need annual polishing, while cars exposed to elements may benefit from bi-annual treatment. Over-polishing can thin clear coat, so professional assessment is crucial."
  - question: "Will polishing remove deep scratches?"
    answer: "Polishing can remove or significantly reduce light to moderate scratches that haven't penetrated through the clear coat. Deep scratches that reach the base coat or primer cannot be fully removed by polishing alone and may require touch-up paint or repainting. Our technicians assess each scratch and recommend the appropriate correction method."
  - question: "How long does paint correction take?"
    answer: "Paint correction duration varies based on vehicle size and paint condition. Single-stage correction takes 6-8 hours, two-stage correction takes 12-16 hours, and multi-stage correction for severely damaged paint can take 20-30 hours. We never rush the process—perfection requires time and precision."
  - question: "Is polishing safe for my car's paint?"
    answer: "Yes, when performed by trained professionals using proper techniques and equipment. We use paint thickness gauges to measure clear coat depth before polishing, ensuring we never remove too much material. Our multi-stage approach uses progressively finer compounds to achieve flawless results while preserving paint integrity."
  - question: "Should I polish before applying ceramic coating or PPF?"
    answer: "Paint correction is essential before ceramic coating or PPF application. These protection methods lock in whatever condition the paint is in, so any imperfections will be sealed permanently. We always perform thorough paint correction to ensure your vehicle achieves a flawless finish before protection application."
