faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between 1-stage and 2-stage polish?"
    answer: "1-stage polishing removes light swirls and enhances gloss in a single step. 2-stage uses a cutting compound to remove deeper scratches first, then a finishing polish for maximum gloss and clarity."
  - question: "How long does paint correction last?"
    answer: "The correction is permanent, but new scratches can occur from washing and environmental factors. With proper maintenance and protection (ceramic coating or wax), results can last 6-12 months before needing touch-ups."
  - question: "Can all scratches be removed?"
    answer: "Most swirls and light-to-moderate scratches can be removed. Deep scratches that penetrate through the clear coat to the base coat or primer cannot be polished out and may require paint touch-up or respray."
  - question: "Do I need paint correction before ceramic coating?"
    answer: "Yes, paint correction is essential before ceramic coating. The coating magnifies the paint's condition and locks it in permanently, so any swirls or scratches must be removed first for optimal results."

## Restore Your Paint's True Beauty

Paint correction is the process of removing surface imperfections like swirl marks, scratches, oxidation, and holograms through machine polishing. This multi-stage process gradually refines the paint surface to achieve a deep, mirror-like finish.

Using professional-grade polishers, specialized compounds, and years of expertise, we can restore even heavily damaged paint to better-than-new condition.
