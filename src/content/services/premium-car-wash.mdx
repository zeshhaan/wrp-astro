faqs:
  - question: "How often should I wash my car in Dubai?"
    answer: "We recommend washing every 1-2 weeks in Dubai due to dust and sand accumulation. For vehicles with ceramic coating, weekly washes help maintain the hydrophobic properties and keep the coating performing optimally."
  - question: "Why avoid automatic car washes?"
    answer: "Automatic car washes use harsh brushes that create swirl marks and scratches, especially damaging to ceramic coatings and clear bra. Our pH-neutral hand wash with soft microfiber ensures your vehicle's protection stays intact."
  - question: "What's included in the interior detailing?"
    answer: "Full interior detailing includes vacuuming, steam cleaning, leather conditioning, dashboard treatment, door panel cleaning, and glass cleaning. We use pH-balanced products safe for all surfaces."
