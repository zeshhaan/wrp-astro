faqs:
  - question: "What makes your car wash 'premium' compared to regular car washes?"
    answer: "Our premium car wash uses pH-neutral, luxury-grade products specifically formulated for high-end vehicles. We employ a two-bucket hand wash method, microfiber towels, and soft brushes to prevent scratches. Unlike automated car washes that can damage paint and trim, our trained technicians hand-wash every surface with meticulous care. We also use filtered, spot-free water for the final rinse."
  - question: "How often should I wash my car in Dubai?"
    answer: "In Dubai's dusty environment, we recommend washing your vehicle every 1-2 weeks to prevent sand and dust buildup that can scratch paint. During sandstorm season, more frequent washing may be necessary. Regular washing prevents contaminants from bonding to paint and maintains protective coatings like ceramic coating or wax."
  - question: "Is hand washing really better than automatic car washes?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Automatic car washes use harsh brushes that create swirl marks and scratches, especially on luxury vehicles with delicate paint. Our hand wash method uses soft microfiber materials and proper techniques to safely clean without damaging paint, trim, or protective films. For high-end vehicles, hand washing is the only safe option."
  - question: "Do you offer mobile car wash services in Dubai?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer premium mobile car wash services throughout Dubai for clients who prefer the convenience of having their vehicle detailed at home or office. Our mobile units are equipped with filtered water systems and all necessary equipment to deliver the same quality service as our studio. Advance booking is required."
  - question: "What's included in interior detailing?"
    answer: "Our interior detailing includes thorough vacuuming of all surfaces, leather conditioning, dashboard and trim cleaning, door jamb cleaning, window cleaning (inside), and air vent detailing. We use luxury-grade products safe for all materials including leather, Alcantara, carbon fiber, and wood trim. Stain removal and odor elimination are available as add-ons."
  - question: "Can you remove water spots and stubborn stains?"
    answer: "Yes, we specialize in removing water spots, bird droppings, tree sap, and other stubborn contaminants. For light water spots, our decontamination process is sufficient. Severe etching may require light polishing. We also offer clay bar treatment to remove bonded contaminants that regular washing can't eliminate—essential in Dubai's environment."
