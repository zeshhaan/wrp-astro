faqs:
  - question: "Is window tinting legal in Dubai and the UAE?"
    answer: "Yes, window tinting is legal in the UAE with specific regulations. Front windshield tinting is generally not permitted, while side and rear windows can be tinted up to 50% VLT (Visible Light Transmission). We ensure all our installations comply with UAE traffic laws and RTA regulations to avoid fines."
  - question: "How much heat does window film actually block in Dubai's climate?"
    answer: "Premium ceramic window films can reject up to 99% of UV rays and 60-80% of solar heat. In Dubai's extreme temperatures, this translates to significantly cooler cabin temperatures, reduced AC load, and improved fuel efficiency. Our clients report interior temperature reductions of 10-15°C on average."
  - question: "What's the difference between ceramic and regular window film?"
    answer: "Ceramic films use nano-ceramic technology that blocks heat without metal particles, providing superior heat rejection without interfering with GPS, radio, or mobile signals. Regular films may contain metals that can cause signal interference. Ceramic films also offer better clarity, durability, and don't fade over time—crucial for Dubai's harsh sun exposure."
  - question: "How long does window film installation take?"
    answer: "Professional window film installation typically takes 2-4 hours for a standard sedan and 4-6 hours for larger SUVs or vehicles with complex window shapes. We recommend leaving your vehicle with us for a full day to ensure proper curing and quality control in our climate-controlled facility."
  - question: "Will window film damage my car's defrost lines or electronics?"
    answer: "No, professional-grade window films are safe for all vehicle electronics including rear defrost lines, antennas, and sensors. Our installation process is specifically designed to protect these components. We use high-quality films that won't interfere with any electronic systems in modern luxury vehicles."
  - question: "How do I maintain window film after installation?"
    answer: "Window film requires minimal maintenance. Wait 3-7 days before cleaning to allow proper curing. Use soft cloths and ammonia-free cleaners. Avoid abrasive materials or sharp objects. In Dubai's dusty environment, regular gentle cleaning maintains clarity. Our films come with warranties covering fading, bubbling, and peeling."
